**Nofar's solution**

I used ngrok to create the static payload URL.

1. First start ngrok: run `ngrok http <PORT>`.
   Note: the default port this app listens to is 3001.

2. Next, start the command line app by running `npm start`.
   - You can change the port number in `config.js`
   - To get full details of the event, change `VERBOSE` in `config.js` to true.

4. Perform actions on any of the repositories of the organizaion **nofars-exercise** and watch the magic happen!
